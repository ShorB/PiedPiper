<p>Task description:</p>
You need to make a landing page - turn the drawn layout into a working page in HTML and CSS.<br/><br/>
<p>Page requirements:</p>
• The header stays at the top of the screen when scrolling through the page.<br/>
• Content is nested in a block whose width is hard-coded to 1219px, side paddings are 55px each.<br/>
• Clicking on links in the header should take you to the appropriate sections of the page.<br/>
• Clicking on the logo should take you to the very top of the page.<br/>
• Content within sections should be centered so that it doesn't stick to the right edge on large screens.<br/>
